MGNREGA Data Canvas: Interactive Excel Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive Excel dashboard designed to visualize and analyze MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) data across the top 10 performing states in India.

## Overview

The dashboard aims to provide insights into key performance indicators such as:

* Household vs. Individual Employment
* Budget Allocation vs. Actual Expenditure
* Average Wage Rate per Person per Day
* Completed and Ongoing Works
* Regional Disparities

It uses Excel's powerful visualization tools, including charts, pivot tables, and slicers, to present the data in a user-friendly and interactive manner.

## Features

* **Interactive Slicers:** Filter data by month and other relevant dimensions.
* **Dynamic Charts:** Visualize trends and comparisons across states.
* **Pivot Tables:** Summarize and analyze data from different perspectives.
* **Internal Links:** Navigate between different sheets within the dashboard.

2.  **Open in Excel:** Open the file in Microsoft Excel.
3.  **Enable Content:** If prompted, enable content and macros (if applicable).

## Troubleshooting

* **Slicers Not Working:**
